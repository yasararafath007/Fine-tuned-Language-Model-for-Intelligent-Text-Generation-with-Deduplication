# Fine-tuned-Language-Model-for-Intelligent-Text-Generation-with-Deduplication
Problem Statement:

Developing an intelligent text generation system using fine-tuned language models to enhance response quality in conversational applications while addressing redundancy issues.

My Contribution:
Implemented a fine-tuning process for a language model using GradientAI platform.
Introduced a data deduplication mechanism based on cosine similarity to improve response uniqueness.
Collaborated on creating model adapters and fine-tuning iterations for enhanced performance.

Tools Used:
GradientAI platform for language model fine-tuning.
scikit-learn for cosine similarity calculation.
Google Colab for collaborative development.

Outcome:
Successfully fine-tuned a language model to generate contextually relevant responses.
Implemented a deduplication mechanism to eliminate redundancy and improve response variety.
Contributed to the development of an advanced conversational AI system with enhanced text generation capabilities.
